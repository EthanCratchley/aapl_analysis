AAPL Income Statement Analysis:

Project that studies the most recent income statement from Apple. With the code provided I scraped the website, cleaned the code, and visualized the data.

Steps:

1. Pick a website you would ike to scrape your financial data from.
2. Scrape the financial data
3. Clean the data
4. Create visualizations for the data.

Right now this code is setup for the AAPL Income Statement Analysis I did but you could pretty easily switch it out for another company and set of financials.

The code is not perfect and is subject to change.
